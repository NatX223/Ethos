## Overview

Ethos is a cross-chain staking and donation protocol that transforms traditional DeFi into a purpose-driven experience. Built for Base Ecosystem, Ethos enables users to stake assets while supporting goal achievement and charitable causes.

Our motto **"Bet on yourself, that's the ethos"** reflects our mission to make every financial transaction create positive social impact.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to stay consistent with their personal or fitness goals because there‚Äôs little accountability or tangible consequence for giving up midway.

## Solution

Ethos introduces a novel cross-chain protocol where:

- **Users lock ETH** to commit to personal goals
- **Automated verification** tracks progress using real-world data (GitHub, Strava, on-chain activity)
- **Reward distribution** rewards goal achievement by redistributing lock funds 
back to the community(from those that did not acheive their goals)

Our hybrid validation system combines backend efficiency with blockchain transparency, creating a seamless user experience while maintaining verifiable on-chain results.

## How It Works

### 1. User Onboarding & Goal Setting

User Flow:
1. Connect Base wallet/account
2. Deploy individual Goal contract
3. Initialize with deadline, target, and lock ETH
4. Wait for settlement at deadline or when the goal target is met

### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

### Technologies Used
```
Smart Contracts
Solidity 0.8.28 with OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard
BASE network deployment
Hardhat development framework
Backend & Infrastructure
Node.js with Express server

REST APIs for external data integration
Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites
Node.js 16+
Git
Base wallet/account
```

### Weekly Reward System

Key Mechanics:
````
Weekly Tracking: Each goal is associated with a specific week

Winner Eligibility: Users who achieve 100% of targets become eligible for weekly rewards

Pool Funding: Funds from partially completed goals feed the weekly reward pool

Fair Distribution: Rewards distributed proportionally among weekly winners
````

## Contract Flow Interaction
