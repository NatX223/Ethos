## Overview

Ethos is a cross-chain staking and donation protocol that transforms traditional DeFi into a purpose-driven experience. Built for both Ethereum and Flow ecosystems, Ethos enables users to stake assets while supporting goal achievement and charitable causes.

Our motto **"Stake with Purpose"** reflects our mission to make every financial transaction create positive social impact.

## Problem Statement

The current DeFi landscape lacks meaningful social impact integration. Traditional staking protocols focus solely on financial returns, missing opportunities to:

- Align financial incentives with personal growth and social good
- Provide verifiable accountability for goal achievement  
- Create transparent donation mechanisms within DeFi
- Bridge multiple blockchain ecosystems for broader impact

Users want their crypto investments to do more than just generate yield‚Äîthey want to support causes they care about and be accountable to their personal goals.

## Solution

Ethos introduces a novel cross-chain protocol where:

- **Users stake ETH or FLOW** to commit to personal goals
- **Automated verification** tracks progress using real-world data (GitHub, Strava, on-chain activity)
- **Smart yield distribution** rewards goal achievement while funding charitable causes
- **Multi-chain architecture** ensures broad accessibility across Ethereum and Flow ecosystems

Our hybrid validation system combines backend efficiency with blockchain transparency, creating a seamless user experience while maintaining verifiable on-chain results.

## How It Works

### 1. User Onboarding & Goal Setting

User Flow:
1. Connect Ethereum wallet
2. Deploy individual Goal contract
3. Initialize with deadline, target, and stake ETH
4. Wait for settlement at deadline


### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
contract Goal is ReentrancyGuard {
    address public author;
    address public settler;
    uint256 public amount;
    address public rewardManager;
    uint256 public week;
    uint256 public deadline;
    uint256 public target;
    bool public isSettled;

    function initialize(uint256 _deadline, uint256 _target) external payable;
    function settleGoal(uint256 score) external onlySettler afterDeadline notSettled;
} 

2. Reward Manager 

contract RewardManager {
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public weeklyRewardAmount;
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public userEligibility;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public weeklyWinnerCount;
    
    function updateWeeklyWinnerCount(address _user, uint256 _week) external;
    function updateWeeklyReward(uint256 _week, uint256 _amount) external;
}

3. Goal Settlement Logic

function settleGoal(uint256 score) external onlySettler afterDeadline notSettled {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    
    if (score >= target) {
        // Full success: 100% refund + winner status
        payable(author).transfer(balance);
        IRewardManager(rewardManager).updateWeeklyWinnerCount(author, week);
    } else {
        // Partial success: proportional refund
        uint256 completion = (score * 1e18) / target;
        uint256 userShare = (balance * completion) / 1e18;
        uint256 remainder = balance - userShare;

        if (userShare > 0) payable(author).transfer(userShare);
        if (remainder > 0) {
            payable(rewardManager).transfer(remainder);
            IRewardManager(rewardManager).updateWeeklyReward(week, remainder);
        }
    }
    isSettled = true;
} 
```

### Technologies Used
```
Smart Contracts
Solidity 0.8.28 with OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard
Ethereum/BASE network deployment
Hardhat development framework
Backend & Infrastructure
Node.js with Express server
Firebase for data management
REST APIs for external data integration
Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites
Node.js 16+
Git
Alchemy/Infura account

```

### Weekly Reward System

Key Mechanics:
````
Weekly Tracking: Each goal is associated with a specific week

Winner Eligibility: Users who achieve 100% of targets become eligible for weekly rewards

Pool Funding: Funds from partially completed goals feed the weekly reward pool

Fair Distribution: Rewards distributed proportionally among weekly winners
````
