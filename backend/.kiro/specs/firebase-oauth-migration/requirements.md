# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the accountability backend from MongoDB/Mongoose to Firebase Firestore, implementing OAuth integrations for GitHub and Strava, and setting up automated daily verification processes. The system will enable users to connect their external accounts for automated goal tracking while maintaining the existing blockchain-based accountability mechanism.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration to Firebase

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from MongoDB to Firebase Firestore so that I can leverage Firebase's real-time capabilities, built-in authentication, and better scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Firebase Firestore instead of MongoDB
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL be persisted in Firestore collections with proper indexing
3. WHEN goal data is queried THEN it SHALL retrieve data from Firestore with sub-collection relationships
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing MongoDB schemas SHALL be converted to Firestore document structures
5. IF a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry logic

### Requirement 2: GitHub OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my GitHub account so that the system can automatically track my coding goals based on commit activity, repository contributions, and coding streaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates GitHub connection THEN the system SHALL redirect to GitHub OAuth authorization
2. WHEN GitHub authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely in the user's profile
3. WHEN the system needs GitHub data THEN it SHALL use the stored token to fetch user's commit history, repositories, and contribution data
4. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL handle refresh token flow automatically
5. IF GitHub API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN a user disconnects GitHub THEN the system SHALL revoke tokens and remove stored credentials

### Requirement 3: Strava OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Strava account so that the system can automatically track my fitness goals based on activities, distance, and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Strava connection THEN the system SHALL redirect to Strava OAuth authorization
2. WHEN Strava authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL store access and refresh tokens securely
3. WHEN the system needs fitness data THEN it SHALL fetch activities, athlete stats, and performance metrics from Strava API
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh token
5. IF Strava API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and queuing
6. WHEN a user disconnects Strava THEN the system SHALL properly clean up stored credentials

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile to store my connected accounts and preferences so that I can manage my integrations and goal tracking settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user profile is created THEN it SHALL include fields for connected accounts (GitHub, Strava)
2. WHEN OAuth connections are made THEN the profile SHALL store usernames, athlete IDs, and connection status
3. WHEN a user views their profile THEN they SHALL see all connected accounts and their status
4. WHEN connection data is stored THEN it SHALL include metadata like connection date and last sync
5. IF account connections fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and notify the user appropriately

### Requirement 5: Daily Automated Verification Cron Job

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated daily verification processes so that goals are checked regularly without manual intervention, ensuring timely and accurate accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cron job runs daily THEN it SHALL check all active goals approaching their deadlines
2. WHEN verification is needed THEN it SHALL fetch latest data from connected APIs (GitHub, Strava)
3. WHEN goal progress is calculated THEN it SHALL update the goal's current value and status
4. WHEN a goal deadline is reached THEN it SHALL trigger blockchain contract finalization
5. WHEN verification completes THEN it SHALL log results and send notifications to users
6. IF API calls fail during verification THEN it SHALL retry with exponential backoff
7. WHEN the cron job encounters errors THEN it SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Goal Tracking Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced goal tracking that leverages my connected accounts so that my progress is automatically updated based on real activity data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a coding goal is created THEN it SHALL support metrics like commits, lines of code, repositories created
2. WHEN a fitness goal is created THEN it SHALL support metrics like distance, calories, activities, elevation gain
3. WHEN progress is calculated THEN it SHALL aggregate data from the appropriate connected service
4. WHEN multiple data sources are available THEN the system SHALL use the most accurate and recent data
5. IF data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual progress updates as fallback

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want my connected account data to be secure and private so that my personal information and activity data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
3. WHEN user data is accessed THEN it SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN old tokens SHALL be securely disposed of
5. IF security breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL revoke all tokens and notify users
6. WHEN users delete their accounts THEN all connected account data SHALL be permanently removed

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues with external API integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including response codes and messages
2. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry strategies
3. WHEN system health is checked THEN it SHALL verify connectivity to all external services
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized by severity and appropriate alerts sent
5. IF critical services are down THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
